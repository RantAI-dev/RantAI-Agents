## Frequently Asked Questions - Life Insurance

### Q: How much life insurance do I need?
A: A common guideline is 10-12 times your annual income. However, consider factors like:
- Outstanding debts (mortgage, loans)
- Future expenses (children's education)
- Spouse's income and needs
- Existing savings and assets

### Q: What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?
A: Term life provides coverage for a specific period (10-30 years) with lower premiums. Whole life provides lifetime coverage with a cash value component but higher premiums. Term is often best for young families; whole life suits those seeking permanent coverage and wealth building.

### Q: Can I have multiple life insurance policies?
A: Yes, you can own multiple policies from different companies. This is called "laddering" and can be an effective strategy. For example, you might have a 30-year term for mortgage protection and a smaller whole life policy for final expenses.

### Q: What happens if I miss a premium payment?
A: We offer a 31-day grace period. If payment isn't received, term policies may lapse. Whole and universal life policies may use cash value to cover premiums. We'll always notify you before any lapse occurs.

### Q: Do I need a medical exam?
A: Not always. We offer no-exam policies up to certain coverage amounts:
- Term Life Basic: Up to $250,000 (ages 18-45)
- Whole Life Classic: Up to $100,000
Higher amounts typically require a medical exam, which we arrange at no cost to you.

### Q: How long does the application process take?
A: - No-exam policies: 24-48 hours
- Standard policies with exam: 2-4 weeks
- Complex cases: 4-6 weeks

### Q: Are life insurance proceeds taxable?
A: Generally, death benefits paid to beneficiaries are income tax-free. However, if the policy is part of your estate, estate taxes may apply for large estates. Consult a tax advisor for your specific situation.
