## Frequently Asked Questions - Health Insurance

### Q: What is a deductible?
A: The deductible is the amount you pay for covered healthcare services before your insurance starts paying. For example, with a $4,000 deductible, you pay the first $4,000 of covered services. After that, you share costs with copays or coinsurance until you reach your out-of-pocket maximum.

### Q: What's the difference between copay and coinsurance?
A: A copay is a fixed amount you pay for a service (e.g., $30 for a doctor visit). Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost you pay (e.g., 20% of a hospital bill). Copays are more predictable; coinsurance can vary based on total cost.

### Q: Can I keep my current doctor?
A: Use our Find a Doctor tool or call us to verify your doctor is in-network. If your preferred doctor is out-of-network, you can still see them but at higher out-of-pocket costs, or you can request we add them to our network.

### Q: What is an out-of-pocket maximum?
A: This is the most you'll pay for covered services in a plan year. Once you reach this amount, your insurance pays 100% of covered services. For example, with a $7,500 out-of-pocket max, once you've paid $7,500 in deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, everything else is fully covered.

### Q: Are pre-existing conditions covered?
A: Yes! Under the ACA, we cannot deny coverage or charge more due to pre-existing conditions. All health conditions are covered from day one of your policy.

### Q: How does telehealth work?
A: Download the HorizonLife app or visit our website to schedule a video or phone visit with a licensed physician. Available 24/7 for non-emergency care. Most visits are $0 copay on Silver and above plans.

### Q: What if I need care while traveling?
A: - Domestic travel: Use any in-network provider
- Emergency care: Always covered at in-network rates
- International: Platinum plans include worldwide emergency coverage
- All plans: 24/7 nurse hotline available

### Q: When can I enroll or make changes?
A: - Open Enrollment: November 1 - January 15 annually
- Special Enrollment: Within 60 days of qualifying life event (marriage, birth, job loss, moving)
- Employer plans: Follow employer's enrollment periods

### Q: Do you cover mental health services?
A: Yes, mental health coverage is comprehensive:
- Outpatient therapy sessions
- Psychiatry visits
- Inpatient mental health
- Substance abuse treatment
- Crisis intervention
- Same copays as medical visits (mental health parity)

### Q: What preventive services are free?
A: All plans cover these at 100%, no copay or deductible:
- Annual wellness exam
- Immunizations (flu, COVID, etc.)
- Cancer screenings (mammogram, colonoscopy, etc.)
- Women's preventive services
- Well-child visits
