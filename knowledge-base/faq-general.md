## Understanding Your Coverage

### Insurance Basics

#### Q: What's the difference between premium, deductible, and copay?
A: Here's a simple breakdown:

**Premium**: What you pay for insurance (monthly, quarterly, or annually)
- Like a membership fee
- You pay this whether or not you use the insurance

**Deductible**: What you pay before insurance kicks in
- Example: $2,000 deductible means you pay the first $2,000 of costs
- After that, insurance helps pay

**Copay**: Fixed amount you pay for specific services
- Example: $30 for a doctor visit
- You pay this even after meeting deductible

**Coinsurance**: Percentage you pay after deductible
- Example: 20% coinsurance means you pay 20%, insurance pays 80%

#### Q: What does "in-network" vs "out-of-network" mean?
A:
**In-Network**: Doctors, hospitals, and facilities that have contracts with HorizonLife
- Lower costs for you
- We've negotiated discounted rates
- Usually requires only copay/coinsurance

**Out-of-Network**: Providers without HorizonLife contracts
- Higher costs for you
- You may pay a larger percentage
- Some plans have no out-of-network coverage (except emergencies)

Always verify a provider is in-network before your visit at horizonlife.com/find-provider

#### Q: What is an EOB (Explanation of Benefits)?
A: An EOB is NOT a bill. It's a statement showing:
- Services you received
- What the provider charged
- What HorizonLife paid
- What you may owe the provider

Review your EOBs to understand your healthcare costs and catch any errors.

#### Q: What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?
A:

**Term Life Insurance:**
- Coverage for a set period (10, 20, 30 years)
- Lower premiums
- No cash value
- Good for: temporary needs, young families, mortgage protection

**Whole Life Insurance:**
- Coverage for your entire life
- Higher premiums
- Builds cash value
- Good for: lifetime protection, estate planning, legacy
