## Frequently Asked Questions - Home Insurance

### Q: How much home insurance do I need?
A: Your dwelling coverage should equal the cost to completely rebuild your home at current construction prices (not the market value or what you paid). We recommend a professional rebuild estimate. Personal property should cover all your belongings at replacement cost.

### Q: What's the difference between actual cash value and replacement cost?
A: Actual Cash Value (ACV) pays the depreciated value of damaged items (a 5-year-old TV pays like a 5-year-old TV). Replacement Cost pays what it costs to buy a new equivalent item. We strongly recommend replacement cost coverage.

### Q: Does home insurance cover floods?
A: No, standard home insurance does NOT cover flood damage. You need a separate flood insurance policy. We recommend flood insurance even if you're not in a high-risk zone—over 25% of flood claims come from low-risk areas.

### Q: What about earthquakes?
A: Earthquake damage is also excluded from standard policies. If you're in an earthquake-prone area (California, Pacific Northwest, etc.), we recommend earthquake insurance.

### Q: Is my home office covered?
A: Basic business equipment (computer, printer) has limited coverage under standard policies. If you run a business from home, you may need additional home business coverage or a separate business policy.

### Q: What if someone gets hurt on my property?
A: Your liability coverage pays for medical bills and legal expenses if someone is injured on your property and you're found responsible. Medical payments coverage pays smaller amounts regardless of fault. We recommend at least $300,000 liability plus an umbrella policy.

### Q: How are premiums calculated?
A: Factors include:
- Home's rebuild cost
- Location (fire station distance, crime rates)
- Age and condition of home
- Construction materials
- Claims history
- Credit score (where permitted)
- Deductible chosen
- Coverage limits
- Discounts applied

### Q: What's not covered by home insurance?
A: Common exclusions include:
- Floods (separate policy required)
- Earthquakes (separate policy required)
- Normal wear and tear
- Intentional damage
- Neglect or lack of maintenance
- Nuclear hazards
- War
- Government action
- Ordinance or law (unless added)
- Mold (limited, can be added)

### Q: Do I need insurance on a condo or rental?
A: - **Condo**: Yes, you need an HO-6 policy covering your unit's interior, personal property, and liability. The condo association covers the building exterior.
- **Rental**: You need renters insurance (HO-4) to cover personal property and liability. The landlord insures the building.

### Q: How do I lower my home insurance costs?
A: - Increase your deductible
- Bundle with auto insurance
- Install security systems
- Install smoke detectors and fire alarms
- Update electrical, plumbing, heating
- Maintain good credit
- Stay claims-free
- Ask about all available discounts
